<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In this volume I have attempted not simply
to give a brief account of a recent trip to
Yellowstone National Park and to describe
some of Nature's grandeurs, but to elucidate
spiritual truths that were demonstrated in this
place of many "wonders" in a thousand miracles
before my eyes.</p>

<p>There is no more poetical, picturesque, and
fascinating spot on the globe, and no other
place where magnificence and sublimity blend
so harmoniously with the softest tints and colorings
as in the Yellowstone region.</p>

<p>Here are geological formations in which
the book of ages has been written in inks of
variegated hues. In the canyons, rivers, and
waterfalls, in the lakes, springs, and pools,
specimens of Eden have been preserved on the
outside of a thin crust, covering the sulphurous
flames of the regions below, where the
rumblings of God's wrath are heard threatening
the world with judgments.</p>

<p>The mighty forces that operated in ages
past are still at His command, demonstrated
by the boiling springs, the volcanoes and spouting
geysers. Ten thousand omens are heralding
the approach of the winding-up of this age,
and the beginning of a new dispensation in
which all men shall acknowledge Jehovah in
His majesty and power as the one and only
Potentate worthy of the adoration and homage
of the human race.</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL STATEMENT</h2>


<p>In a book entitled, <i>The Discovery of Yellowstone
Park</i>, written by Nathaniel P.
Langford, the author gives an account of
an expedition of 130 persons who started from
St. Paul, June 16, 1862, for the Salmon River,
as it had been widely rumored that extensive
placer mines had been discovered there. The
expedition was led by Captain James L. Fisk,
the noted Indian fighter. Among his assistants
were E. H. Burritt, Nathaniel P. Langford,
and Samuel R. Bond, who acted as
secretary. David E. Folsom, Robert C. Knox,
Cornelius Bray, Patrick Doherty, Ard Godfrey,
and Patrick Bray, were selected for
guard duty. Many well-known pioneers of
Montana were in this company, whose names
are familiar to the writer.</p>

<p>After eighteen weeks of hazardous adventure,
the expedition arrived, on the 23d of October,
at Grasshopper Creek. The weather
being too cold for them to proceed on the journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
they decided to camp in that locality for
the winter. This region was then the rendezvous
of the Bannack Indians; and the St. Paul
expedition named the settlement Bannack.</p>

<p>To me it is a strange coincidence that this
expedition of pioneers should have left St.
Paul on the day of my birth, the 16th of June,
1862; and that on March 31st, 1882, a little
more than nineteen years, later, I should reach
this same locality, having been engaged to
teach the Bannack public school, which I began
the 4th of April.</p>

<p>Frequently the early history of the town
and its inhabitants was rehearsed in my
hearing, but many deplored the fact that some
of the old-timers had moved to Virginia
City, Helena, Butte, and other places, and
that the placer mines of Bannack were not
so prosperous as in former days. But there
were enough of the pioneers left to keep fresh
in the memories of the younger generation
the stories of adventures with wild beasts, the
Indians, etc. Some of the stories were
looked upon as fabrications, while others were
known to be plain statements of facts.</p>

<p>I heard so much about the Indians, their
reprisals and cruelty, that I lived in constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
dread of them, even when there was no cause
for alarm. A short time before I reached Montana,
which was then a territory, there had
been an uprising of some tribes, and a number
of persons living in Bannack and vicinity had
been killed. When they were on the warpath at
this particular time, the inhabitants of Bannack
had to barricade themselves in the new
brick courthouse and stay for days to protect
themselves from a general slaughter.</p>

<p>I was not afraid of the squaws with their
papooses strapped to boards on their backs,
but when the "bucks," as they were called,
pressed their flat noses against the window-panes
asking for muck-a-muck (food), they
frightened me so that I could not get over it
for hours. No one else seemed to have any fear
of them, even though harrowing stories were
everywhere being told about their treachery
and cruelty. I made my home with Aunt
Eliza, my mother's sister, who had married
Dillon B. Mason, a pioneer of Montana, about
ten years before. It was she who had engaged
the public school for me and had insisted
on my coming to Montana, from Kentucky,
to teach at Bannack.</p>

<p>When the Indians on their foraging expeditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the kitchen, it seemed to be my lot
to see them first. When they saw how I was
disturbed at their presence, they would throw
their heads back and laugh, and say, "White
squaw, heaply big fool." My uncle and aunt
were always on friendly terms with them, calling
them John, Jim, and other familiar names.
This pleased them very much, especially when
food was given them; and I knew they would
be around again in a few days, much to my
annoyance.</p>

<p>Patrick Bray of Bannack, whose name is
mentioned in the St. Paul expedition, was one
of the old pioneers who could tell more "blood
and thunder" stories than anyone else in the
community.</p>

<p>In 1870, a party composed of some of the
most prominent citizens of Montana, under the
leadership of General Washburn, then the
Surveyor-General of the Territory, went on an
exploring expedition to the Yellowstone regions.
The names of some of the members of
this party were household words in the early
days of Montana, and familiar to the writer.
Among them were Cornelius Hedges, Nathaniel
P. Langford, the first superintendent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the Park, T. C. Everts, S. T. Hauser, and
Lieut. G. C. Doane. The reader will note the
fact that N. P. Langford was a member of the
St. Paul party under the leadership of Captain
Fisk, that landed on Grasshopper Creek, Montana,
in the fall of 1862; and much of the success
of the expedition was due to his heroism.
Also much credit is due him for his unabating
devotion to the cause of the republic, and the
service he rendered in having the region set
apart as a National Park, March 1st, 1872.
Until this time, there were no restrictions on
hunting, trapping, gathering of specimens,
etc., or to fencing in the geysers by private individuals.
THE ACT OF THE DEDICATION
OF YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL
PARK, approved March 1st, 1872, was as follows:</p>



<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Be it Enacted by the Senate and the House
Of Representatives of the United States Of
America in Congress Assembled</span>:</p>

<p>"That the tract of land in the Territories of Montana
and Wyoming, lying near the headwaters of the
Yellowstone River, and described as follows, to-wit:
Commencing at the junction of Gardiner River with
the Yellowstone River, and running east to the meridian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
passing ten miles to the eastward of the most
eastern point of Yellowstone Lake; thence south
along the said meridian to the parallel of latitude passing
ten miles south of the most southern point of Yellowstone
Lake; thence west along said parallel to the
meridian passing fifteen miles west of the most western
point of Madison Lake; thence north along said
meridian to the latitude of the junction of the Yellowstone
and Gardiner Rivers; thence east to place of
beginning&mdash;is hereby reserved and withdrawn from
settlement, occupancy or sale under the laws of the
United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public
park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment
of the people; and all persons who shall locate, settle
upon or occupy the same or any part thereof, except
as hereinafter provided, shall be considered trespassers
and removed therefrom.</p>

<p>"Sec. 2. The said public Park shall be under the
exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior,
whose duty it shall be, as soon as practicable, to
make and publish such rules and regulations as he
may deem necessary and proper for the care and management
of the same. Such regulations shall provide
for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all
timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities or wonders
within said park and their retention in their
natural condition.</p>

<p>"The Secretary may, in his discretion, grant leases
for building purposes, for terms not exceeding ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

said park as shall require the erection of buildings for
the accommodation of visitors; all the proceeds of
said leases, and all other revenues that may be derived
from any source connected with said park, to be
expended under his direction in the management of
the same, and the construction of roads and bridle
paths therein. He shall provide against the wanton
destruction of the fish and game found within said
park, and against their capture or destruction for the
purpose of merchandise or profit. He shall also cause
all persons trespassing upon the same after the passage
of this act to be removed therefrom, and generally
shall be authorized to take all such measures as
shall be necessary or proper to fully carry out the objects
and purpose of this act."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>ENROUTE TO THE PARK</h3>


<p>On September 2, 1919, I left Zarephath,
New Jersey for Denver, Colorado.
Seven days later, accompanied by my
brother and his wife, Rev. Charles W. and Lillian
O. Bridwell, I started on a trip to the Yellowstone
National Park. Traffic on the railroads
was so heavy out of Denver that we had
some difficulty in getting properly routed, but
finally succeeded. Twenty-four hours later, we
reached Cody, Wyoming, the eastern entrance
to the Park. We secured lodging at the Irma
Hotel, founded by William F. Cody (Buffalo
Bill), and named for his favorite daughter.</p>

<p>On the walls of the office and in the halls of
this hotel were splendid paintings, in which the
whole history of the famous frontiersman and
Indian fighter was shown. Hours could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
profitably be spent studying these pictures, in
which one could learn more about the "Wild
West," of former days, than one could get
from the average history. All of the famous
Indian chiefs were there, among them, Red
Cloud, Sitting Bull, and Black Bird. Their
features were so perfectly outlined I almost
felt I was looking into their faces.</p>

<p>There were so many tourists we were fortunate
in getting accommodations at this place,
when arrangements had not been made ahead.
Since I felt the need of rest, and my brother
wanted more information concerning the tour
through the Park, we concluded to stay over
for a day. We held an open-air Gospel meeting
here, and had the opportunity of getting
acquainted with some of the people whom we
told about the work of the Pillar of Fire organization.</p>

<p>At one time we had about decided to hire an
automobile and drive through the Park, but
later, concluded it would be too much of an
undertaking, and made arrangements with the
Yellowstone Park Transportation Company to
take us through for about forty-three dollars
each; this included board and lodging at the
Yellowstone Camps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>At 8:15, on the morning of September 12,
we boarded one of the big, yellow touring-cars,
with a number of other passengers, and proceeded
on our journey. We had nothing to do
with the selection of our automobile party, but
could not have been better suited. About four
miles west of Cody, we entered the <span class="smcap">Shoshone
Canyon</span>, three miles from the first tunnel. In
the meantime, we were climbing up the mountainside
so rapidly that it was soon hundreds
of feet to the chasm below.</p>

<p>In a little while we reached the top of the
<span class="smcap">Shoshone Dam</span>, to the left, and here made
our first stop. The scenery, while approaching
and when leaving the dam, was the most magnificent
I have ever beheld. Word-pictures fail
to give even a slight idea of the depths of the
canyon, the wonderful tints and hues caused
by mineral formations and volcanic action in
ages past. The trees on either side were of
such immense height, that I was almost staggered.
I was not expecting anything like this,
on the run from Cody to the boundary of the
Park; and surprises awaited me every moment
of the time.</p>

<span class="caption">SHOSHONE CANYON © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>While waiting at the dam, I copied from a
board the following dimensions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Height, 328 feet,<br />
Thickness at base, 108 feet,<br />
Thickness at top, 10 feet,<br />
Length of crest, 200 feet,<br />
Capacity of reservoir, 456,000 acre-feet,<br />
Area of water surface, 10 square miles,<br />
Maximum width, 4 miles,<br />
Maximum depth, 233 feet,<br />
Length of spillway, 300 feet,<br />
Work begun, 1905,<br />
Work completed, 1910,<br />
Total cost, $1,354,000.<br />
</p>

<p>The scenery approaching the dam on both
sides, was to me so unparalleled and inspiring,
my heart cried out with the Psalmist:</p>

<p>"Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in
all generations. Before the mountains were
brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the
earth and the world, even from everlasting to
everlasting, thou art God.... For a thousand
years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it
is past, and as a watch in the night."</p>

<p>After leaving the dam, we passed slowly
through the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth tunnels.
Twelve miles from Cody we had a magnificent
view of the great <span class="smcap">Shoshone Reservoir</span>
at our left. Then we passed the Morris
Ranch, crossed the bridge over the Shoshone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
River and turned to the right. We passed a
school house, Hollister's Ranch, Frost and
Richard's Ranch, entered Shoshone National
Forest and took the left side road to Canyon
Forest Ranger Station. Two miles farther
was the overhanging Rock Cliff, and other
places of less importance between it and the
Holy City at the right.</p>

<span class="caption">SHOSHONE DAM © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>About forty-one miles from Cody we came
to the Palisades; then followed Mesa Creek,
Good Camp, Elephant Head at the right, Mutilated
Hand, and Eagle Creek. About fifty-three
miles from Cody we arrived at <span class="smcap">Pahaska
Tepee Lodge</span>, founded by Buffalo Bill.
This station is only two miles from the
boundary of the Park. The yellow cars turn
in at the lodge for luncheon. A stop of about
an hour and a half was allowed here. The
house is built of unplaned logs with a large
fireplace and small windows. It has wide
porches, provided with easy chairs for the
tourists. While it has a wild, rustic appearance
it is homelike.</p>

<p>A little brown bear chained to a tree on the
grass plot in front furnished much amusement
for the company by turning somersaults.
Three or four bears had been killed a few days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
before, somewhere in the neighborhood of the
lodge, and bear meat was served at luncheon.
However, none of the three members of our
party ate animal flesh.</p>

<p>We asked that eggs might be substituted,
but our request was not granted, and we
had to be content with what we could get.
We did not find the courtesy and interest manifested
in our welfare here, on the part of the
managers, that we expected; and we felt that
if we had to meet the same difficulties farther
on, it would be a matter of regret to us that we
did not hire a conveyance and make an independent
tour. Fortunately, we found a decided
difference in the management at the
camps.</p>

<p>Two young women, who had been residing
in the park camps for the summer, had arranged
with the driver of our car to sit on the
front seat with him on the trip from Cody to
Yellowstone Camp. However, they were not
on hand in the morning when we were ready
to start, and a person who had later secured
the front seat kindly let me have it. I was
grateful for the protection the wind-shield gave
me, and of being able to keep my feet warm
near the engine. When the young women found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
that they had been left, they hired an automobile
and overtook us. They paid a woman
chauffeur, clad in men's clothing, ten dollars for
this trip; and just as we were halting at the
dam they drove up, to the delight of the young
man who was driving our car.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">&nbsp;</a></span>

<span class="caption">THE HOLY CITY © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>Nothing was said to me about giving them
the front seat, but they made some remarks in
the presence of others that showed plainly what
was on their minds. I kept my place until we
reached Pahaska Lodge. In the meantime
"Heine," the driver, as he was called, seemed
more or less excited, and occasionally called to
them in the rear seat. He was running at such
speed it was difficult for some of the passengers
to keep their places, especially where there were
sharp curves in the road. He was, no doubt, a
skilful driver. He seemed to know that he was
exceeding the speed limit, and shouted out to
one of the young women, "Ruth, are you all
there?" A few minutes after this he ran
against the post of a bridge and came near
having a wreck, but no one said anything to
him, nor made a protest against his carelessness
and levity when he should have been attending
to business.</p>

<p>"Heine" spent the time at Pahaska Lodge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
in the company of the two girls; and when
the time came to go, he did not wait, as
others did, to load up in front of the building,
but took them out to the rear where the car was
standing and put them in the front seat. There
was a protest on the part of all the other passengers,
who insisted that he should give me
the seat I had occupied in the morning, but he
was unyielding; and after a half hour's delay
and controversy they saw the utter futility of
trying to convince him of his act of injustice,
and proceeded on the journey. However, it
served the purpose of quieting him down and
causing him to be more careful in the dangerous
places of the road.</p>

<span class="caption">PAHASKA TEPEE LODGE © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>The woman in charge at the Pahaska
Lodge, who had failed to serve us with eggs,
after one of the waitresses had promised them
to me, was chafing under an impeachment of
her lack of good will and hospitality toward
some of her patrons; and came boldly out to the
car, and in the presence of every one took sides
with the driver, assuring him that she would
stand for the delay. This greatly strengthened
him in the stand he had taken.</p>

<p>It was not very pleasant to ride behind a
driver with so much responsibility, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
carrying on a flirtation. I once saw a brakeman
flirting with a young woman when he should
have been attending to business. Suddenly, he
lost his footing, fell between the cars and was
crushed to death. Human nature has been so
weakened through the fall that there is not
much dependence to be put in one where a play
by the opposite sex is being made on the heartstrings.
Samson was shorn of his strength
by the fair-faced Delilah, and made to grind
without eyes in the mills of the Philistines,
after he had rent a lion, carried off the gates
of Gaza, and defied all the enemies of Israel.</p>

<p>There is too much good-natured toleration
of such things, where human lives are involved.
Most people choose the path of least resistance,
when it does not seriously interfere with their
rights or comfort, but not so with our fellow
passengers, four of whom were devout members
of the Friends' Church. There was a
principle involved, and they did not hesitate to
show on which side they were. We enjoyed
the company of these "Friends" very much.
The two gentlemen and their wives were our
companions on the trip from the morning we
left Cody till the day we parted at the Old
Faithful Camp at the Upper Geyser Basin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>GRAND CANYON OF THE YELLOWSTONE</h3>


<p>After crossing the Yellowstone boundary,
about two miles west of Pahaska
Tepee Lodge, I began to feel
an atmosphere of freedom that I had not
hitherto enjoyed on the trip. I felt that
the Yellowstone National Park, with all of its
wonders and many interests, belonged to me as
much as to any other person on the earth; and
from that moment it seemed that I was walking
with God to the very gates of heaven and to the
brink of hell. The freedom of animal life in
the Park, brought to my mind vivid pictures
of the Millennium, when, as Isaiah says,
nothing shall hurt or destroy in all God's holy
mountain. It should be a matter of great interest
and satisfaction to Americans that our
government has the custody of the Yellowstone&mdash;that
man with selfish interests is prohibited
from laying claim to anything within its boundaries,
and is compelled to refrain from marring
or defacing the formations around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
geysers and other places, and from destroying
animal life.</p>

<p>It is to be deplored that so few know how
rich they are in the gifts that God and nature
have bestowed upon us as a people, in this vast
region of more than 3,000 square miles of so
many miracles and wonders.</p>

<p>About eight miles from the border, we came
to Sylvan Pass; then followed Snow Fall, Lake
Eleanor, Sylvan Lodge, Sylvan Lake, and
Wedded Trees, at the left. About eleven miles
from Sylvan Pass, we came to Turbid Lake,
Osprey Nest in a tree at the right, Fishing
Bridge, Yellowstone River, and turned to the
right to Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>Our first stop after leaving Pahaska Lodge
was at <span class="smcap">Mud Volcano</span> and <span class="smcap">Green Gable
Spring</span>, at the left. This was the first place
where we had found any disturbance on the
surface caused by the heated regions below.
The angry crater of the volcano resembled, in
some respects, the Mammoth Paint Pots in the
Lower Geyser Basin, but unlike the latter,
there was nothing beautiful about it,&mdash;it was
simply a great mass of boiling mud, manifesting
such intense heat as to spout up several feet,
threatening to bespatter those who came too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
near. It was enclosed by a railing, around
which was a board walk. Below the mud
geyser was a boiling spring where the water,
clear as crystal, poured out of the ground and
was carried away.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">&nbsp;</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_036.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="SYLVAN LAKE" title="SYLVAN LAKE" />
<span class="caption">SYLVAN LAKE © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>I ventured to put my finger into the water
and was nearly burned. This place was only
a suggestion of what we were to see later in
the Geyser Basins.</p>

<p>At our left, eight miles from Sylvan Pass,
we had a splendid view of <span class="smcap">Yellowstone
Lake</span> in the distance. In the heart of the
Park Plateau, averaging more than eight thousand
feet elevation, surrounded by mountains,
waterfalls, and cascades, is the lake, twenty
miles in length, which, at its elevation, has but
one rival, Lake Titicaca, in the Andes. As our
party did not visit West Thumb, it was our
privilege to see the lake only at a distance,
where we could have but a slight idea of its
beauty and immensity.</p>

<p>"David E. Folsom, of the Folsom and Cook
Exploring Party, in 1869 says:</p>

<blockquote><p>'As we were about departing on our homeward trip,
we ascended the summit of a neighboring hill and took
a final look at Yellowstone Lake. Nestled among
the forest-crowned hills which bounded our vision, lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
this inland sea, its crystal waves dancing and sparkling
in the sunlight as if laughing with joy for their
wild freedom. It is a scene of transcendent beauty,
which has been viewed by but few white men, and we
felt glad to have looked upon it before its primeval
solitude should be broken by the crowds of pleasure-seekers,
which at no distant day will throng its
shores.'"</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_038.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="YELLOWSTONE LAKE" title="YELLOWSTONE LAKE" />
<span class="caption">YELLOWSTONE LAKE © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>For the next few miles the scenery was
most fascinating, but it was only a prelude to
what awaited us in the first glimpse we were
to get of the <span class="smcap">Grand Canyon</span>.</p>

<p>We halted at <span class="smcap">Inspiration Point</span>, where
I followed others down the steps to a
great ledge of rocks overhanging the chasm.
The scene that greeted my vision was so overwhelming
and unexpected that I became dizzy
and had to make my way back to the car, supported
by the railing.</p>

<p>This yawning gulf with its awful depths
of nearly two thousand feet, through which
the river, like a silver thread was wending its
way, and the sublime coloring produced by nature,
reflected from the mineral formations on
the sides of the great canyon, was a sight too
much for human frailty, and I had to be satisfied
to take a glimpse and wait until I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
recuperate from the shock before attempting
another adventure.</p>

<p>Before leaving Inspiration Point, some one
shouted, "See the eagle's nest!" and there, looking
down into a tall pine tree at the right of the
descent, was the nest; but I was more interested
in the canyon, for I had never had the
faintest conception of what it really is.</p>

<p>When I had recuperated somewhat from
the bewilderment, I was inclined to charge
those who had visited the Park before, among
whom were my brother and his wife, with
stupidity and a lack of appreciation for not
having done more to tell of such grandeur.
But afterwards I had to admit that the half cannot
be told however much anyone might try.
Unlike the Royal Gorge in Colorado, we were
not at the bottom looking up, but at the
top looking down into the silent and awful
depths. It was as if the earth had rent asunder
and we were standing on the brink looking
over into the abyss.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Of all the marvels of the Yellowstone National
Park, the most sublime is the Grand Canyon. Through
this the Yellowstone River, which is a tributary of the
Missouri, flows in one place for twenty continuous
miles between perpendicular cliffs only about 200
yards apart and from 1,200 to 1,500 feet in height.
At the entrance of this part of the canyon the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
river makes a stupendous leap of 308 feet, in what is
known as the 'Lower Fall.' The sides of this gigantic
chasm have literally almost all the colors of the rainbow
displayed upon their vertical surfaces. Red,
orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, and white tints,
are constantly succeeding one another here in wonderful
variety, thus lighting up with glory countless
architectural forms, which Nature, it would seem, had
fashioned here to make the proudest works of man appear
diminutive and tame. These colors doubtless
have been formed by the percolating through the cliffs
of the hot mineral waters from the neighboring
springs. Distinguished painters have sadly declared
that any adequate representation of these brilliant, variegated
hues is utterly beyond the power of human
art. What an unrivalled combination is there, therefore,
in this canyon, of awe-inspiring grandeur and
enchanting beauty! And what a magnificent pathway
has been given to the Yellowstone River! Leaving
the famous Yellowstone Lake enclosed by snow-clad
mountains, it passes through a series of rapids
and a fall of 140 feet before it even reaches the
Grand Canyon, and just beyond this it receives a
tributary, which in its haste to join it, makes a leap
of 156 feet. Thus cradled in sublimity, the Yellowstone
River must be called in some respects the most
extraordinary stream upon our continent."</p></blockquote>

<p>Why was this place kept concealed from
the eyes of civilized man for nearly four hundred
years after America was discovered?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Even now only a small per cent of the 100,000,000
people of the United States know what they
possess in this romantic and mysterious region,
which in some places seems to be the ante-chamber
of heaven and the very mouth of hell.
Many, for lack of opportunity or interest, will
never see the Yellowstone National Park, while
multitudes from foreign shores will swarm like
bees within its boundaries and reap the benefits
of the sacrifice and toil of its discoverers
and of God's free gift to America.</p>

<p>When the Queen of Sheba came from the
uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom
of Solomon, and he answered all her questions,
showing her the riches and glory of his
kingdom, she said, "It was a true report that
I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of
thy wisdom. Howbeit I believed not the words,
until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and,
BEHOLD, THE HALF WAS NOT TOLD
ME." This truly could be said of the Grand
Canyon. I have been many times through the
Rocky Mountain regions, passed through the
Royal Gorge, have seen most of the places
of interest that the mountain passes, fastnesses,
and peaks afford, but nothing had ever so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
charmed, awed, inspired, and bewildered me
as did the first glimpse of the Grand Canyon
of the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>Solomon's kingdom symbolizes the second
work of grace, taught in the Scriptures, an experience
which no one can understand unless
he is in possession of it. Experience is necessary
to enjoy it in its fulness, and so with nature's
grandeur and magnificence on such a
tremendous scale as in the Grand Canyon of
the Yellowstone. One must see with the eyes
what the mind fails to grasp by the hearing
of the ear. Language, with its adaptability to
the usages of mortal man, is inadequate. Word-pictures,
though drawn by the most visionary
and gifted, fail to convey in a slight degree
the grandeur of nature's activities and exhibitions
in this the most inspiring and picturesque
spot on the globe.</p>

<p>After I was again seated in the car,
for a few moments my eyes were closed to all
the world about me, and in a new sense I began
to realize the infinite depths of divine
power and wisdom, and how small is the creature
when compared with the Creator.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Artist's View</span> we stopped again for
another look at the canyon. In the opinion of
some persons, a better view was to be had here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
than at Inspiration Point, but I did not think so,
and did not tarry long. Feeling that enough had
been crowded into one day, I went back to
the stage anxious to get where I could relax
and rest.</p>

<p>A few minutes later we arrived at
<span class="smcap">Yellowstone Camp</span>, near the Upper and
Lower Falls. After we had registered and
were shown the way to our tents, the evening
meal was served in a large, spacious dining-room.</p>

<p>In the office of the camp we found a
log fire burning. A score or more of tourists
seated around it were engaged in conversation;
and the new arrivals received a cordial
welcome. Everything presented so homelike
an appearance, it made me feel as if I should
like to spend a week here.</p>

<p>The greatest courtesy was manifested
on the part of the managers and those
who rendered us service, and I felt that they
had a real heart interest in our welfare. The
accommodations in the tents were all that
one could ask. The tents had floors, were
boarded up the sides, and furnished with
all the conveniences necessary. In each one
there was a stove that was lighted both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
morning and evening, as it was late in the season
and sometimes the temperature was almost
at freezing point. When a fire was needed,
one of the attendants at the camp came to
light it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>UPPER AND LOWER FALLS</h3>


<p>After dinner was served on the evening
of our arrival, my brother
and his wife took a trip down
<span class="smcap">Uncle Tom's Trail</span> to the base of the
Lower Yellowstone Fall. They returned
later, excited not a little, to tell of their
adventure and what they had seen. I regretted
that they did not wait until morning
so that I could go with them, but I was so
elated with the description of the fall that I
was determined to go down the trail, if I had
to go alone. The next morning when I saw
how hazardous the undertaking would be, there
was nothing that could have induced me to descend
the rocky steep over which they had traveled.
Sister Lillian and I got a good view of
the fall from a prominence near the edge of
the canyon, and this satisfied me.</p>

<p>Just before the water makes its tremendous
leap, it is compressed within a width of
about 100 feet, where it seems to slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
down to prepare for the shock before it dashes
308 feet over the rocks. Here from the foaming
mass of spray, gorgeous rainbows may be
seen. The eye is then inclined to follow the
little stream that dwindles away between the
rocky sides of the great chasm, foaming and
dashing as it goes, until it looks like a silver
thread in the distance. The rainbow colors
at the fall, blending with the various tints
and hues reflected from the mineral formations
on the sides of the canyon, presented a
picture that no artist could paint.</p>

<p>My sister and I took the trail along the
edge of the canyon and finally made intersection
with the automobile road within a short
distance of the camp. On the way back, I
felt as if I had lighted down on another sphere
where I could stay for only a brief period, and
that I must profit by every moment of time
that was allotted me. Pausing by the roadside,
I asked the question, "What shall it be
when these mortal bodies put on immortality,
when they shall no longer be subject to the laws
of gravitation or others governing material
substances? What shall it be to wing one's
flight to unseen worlds where there is still a
greater comprehension to be had of Him who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
created the world and threw it from the tips
of His fingers into space!"</p>

<p>It took thousands of years for astronomers
to learn that the earth is hung upon nothing;
that when God created it He made it out
of nothing, and set the forces in action that
were continually demonstrating His omnipotence
before their eyes.</p>

<p>The plan of salvation, of which it is my
privilege to be a partaker, was never more precious
to me than at this time, and I had a new
appreciation of the fact that an infinite price
had been paid for man's redemption. I felt
renewed inspiration to press the battle against
sin and unrighteousness to the gates of heaven
or to the depths of hell.</p>

<p>The Calvary route is often rugged. There
are many dangerous places, where if the
Infinite One did not clasp our hands and hold
them tightly, we would plunge to the depths
of the chasm and be wrecked and ruined
for time and eternity. We have the blessed
consolation, however, that He has promised to
guide us with His eye, and never to leave or
forsake those who put their trust in Him.</p>

<p>There is an atmosphere of sincerity among
the people around the hotels and camps of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Yellowstone that is rarely found in summer resorts
in other places. Here the voice of God
in nature is heard in the smallest whisper, and
again in tones of thunder; those who are
inclined to be giddy and possessed with a spirit
of levity, suddenly find themselves sobering up
and beginning to think upon those things that
involve the interests of their immortal souls.</p>

<p>Many of the helpers about the camps and
hotels of the Park, I was told, were students
and teachers who had come to the Yellowstone
unprepared financially to make the tour, and
had accepted positions as waiters, waitresses,
etc., in order to pay their way through, and to
be able to return by the time their schools
opened. Some of them received only slight compensation,
and depended on the good will of
the tourists to reimburse them for services.</p>

<p>The familiarity that was seen everywhere
between man and beast betokens the fact that
an earnest of Isaiah's prophecy of the Millennium
is being fulfilled. These native animals
are free to go wherever they please, and
seem to have little or no fear. In many
instances they come close enough to eat out
of the hands of the tourists. At the park camps
and around the kitchens of the hotels, black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
brown, and occasionally grizzly bears could
be seen at almost any hour of the day eating
out of tins or otherwise in search of food. At
our camp, near the kitchen, I found a brown
bear with two little cubs. She looked at me
with an independent toss of her head as much
as to say, "You may be surprised to see me
here, but I am enjoying the rights and privileges
accorded me under the laws governing
the Park; I am taking no undue liberties nor
committing any offense." She then took an
affectionate look at her cubs and warned me
to keep my distance. I assured her that I had
no thought of disturbing them, and so there
was an understanding between us. I afterward
made frequent visits to the brow of the
hill where I could get a good view of her and
her little ones.</p>

<p>Tourists often make a mistake in trying to
feed and pet the bears. Signs are up everywhere
warning them of this danger. A short
time before our party arrived, some person
tried to pet a bear and was bitten in the wrist.
It taught him and others a lesson. These animals
have not been tamed, and the reason they
are not so vicious as in primeval days is because
no one is allowed to wound or kill them. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
one becomes unmanageable and it is necessary
to dispose of it, the government rangers who
have charge of the Park remove all traces of
blood, and even burn the hide, so as to keep
from arousing suspicion on the part of others.
Thus we see, in part, what the Millennium will
be when nothing shall hurt or destroy, and
when "righteousness shall be the girdle of his
lions, and faithfulness the girdle of his
reins."</p>

<p>"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,
and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and

and a little child shall lead them. And

ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall

(Isa. II:5:9).</p>

<p>We could have spent another day at the
Grand Canyon, as we had arranged for a five-day
tour, but decided to spend more time at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Old Faithful Camp near the Upper Geyser
Basin, and therefore planned to leave in the
afternoon. In the meantime I packed up my
things, made some notes in my diary, and went
alone to the Upper Yellowstone Fall.</p>

<p>Here, with no one present but the unseen
host, I spent one of the most profitable hours of
my life. I was in a position to get a good view
of the Fall, where the water was dashing more
than a hundred feet over the rocks, preparatory
to the final plunge of three hundred feet
a half mile below.</p>

<p>For a short time, surrounded by nature,
with all of its primitive beauty and grandeur,
I seemed to forget my burdens, and had a foretaste
of what it will be when the cross is laid
down and the crown is won. But to be an
overcomer, I knew there must be no shrinking
from duty until the last battle is fought.</p>

<p>Time forbade my tarrying longer at this
place, and I hurried to the camp where I found
my brother and sister looking for me. In a
few minutes we had bidden many of our newly-made
friends good-by and were hurried off in
the yellow touring car <i>via</i> Tower Fall to Mammoth
Hot Springs, a distance of about forty
miles.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_058.jpg" width="600" height="467" alt="UPPER YELLOWSTONE FALL" title="UPPER YELLOWSTONE FALL" />
<span class="caption">UPPER YELLOWSTONE FALL © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>In the car was a new driver, and among the
passengers were the four "Friends" who had
started with us from Cody, Wyoming. We
were glad to have them, and also to have a
change of drivers, so that we might forget the
unpleasant experience of the day before at
Pahaska Tepee Lodge.</p>

<p>Every person in the car seemed to be in
good spirits, and ready to enjoy the trip to the
fullest extent. From the time we left the
camp until we reached Mt. Washburn, a distance
of about ten miles, my time was mostly
taken up answering the questions of a woman
from California who wanted information about
our organization, the Pillar of Fire. I was glad
to answer her questions and to give her all the
enlightenment I could, but I found that it was
taxing my physical strength when I should
be at my best to profit by the trip. I silently
prayed that a change of some kind might be
made. We did not take the automobile road
to the summit of Mt. Washburn, an altitude of
10,388 feet, but turned to the left through <span class="smcap">Dunraven
Pass</span>, along the side of the mountain, a
much shorter road than over the summit.</p>

<p>I had no desire to go to the summit. I had
so often been over the highest peaks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Rockies on all the scenic railroad lines, that I
did not care to tax my nerves on such a trip;
other passengers felt much the same.</p>

<p>The drive around the side of the mountain
was hazardous enough for me; and while
others expressed no fear, there were times
when I felt I should be compelled to get out
of the car and walk. A good-natured pilot
seated by the driver, who, no doubt, was sent
out by the Park company, was skilful enough
to divert my attention from the distance to the
base of the mountain at our left until we had
passed over the dangerous part of the road. I
shall not forget the manner in which he undertook
to make me forget that I was nervous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tower Fall</span> was our first stop. The
dizzy heights had almost unfitted me for what
awaited us at this place, but my brother and
the pilot assisted me up the steps and I followed
others down the trail to the fall, dashing
132 feet over the rocks. The snowy, foaming
water has the appearance of white satin ribbon,
falling perpendicularly between two towering
rocks, whence it gets its name. It lacks
the volume of some other falls in the Yellowstone,
but its grace and beauty are nowhere
surpassed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>About four miles from the fall, we turned
aside to <span class="smcap">Camp Roosevelt</span>, where we found a
great display of elk horns. I was constantly
on the lookout for elk, deer, and other
animals, as I was told that they were
often seen in herds in that locality, but I saw
nothing except a lonely coyote, trotting along
utterly indifferent to our presence. It seems
that the continual blowing of automobile horns
has frightened the more timid creatures back
from the highways, and only occasionally do
they venture close enough to be seen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS</h3>


<p>The distance from Grand Canyon Camp
to Mammoth Hot Springs, near Fort
Yellowstone, was made in about three
and one-half hours, with only the one stop
at Tower Fall, and the few minutes that we
halted at Camp Roosevelt, and the Cold Spring.
But there was not one moment of monotony.
The harmonious blending of colors, the distant
mountain peaks and ranges, the soft-tinted
sky, the trees, the water, in fact, all of Nature's
best, in a milder form than we had seen
about the Grand Canyon at the Upper and
Lower Yellowstone Falls, was constantly presented
in shifting scenes before our vision,
relieving, in a measure, the tension we had
been under since arriving in the vicinity of
the Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>One place, in particular, that attracted my
attention, was a beaver dam and hut that had
been constructed by an order of masons whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
operations are conducted exclusively upon the
principles of home protection, and whose chief
aim is to protect the fur trade of which they
are the producers. In order to do this and to
keep from being stranded, it is often necessary
for the beavers to dam up the waters and build
a house in which to live.</p>

<p>When they cut down trees, they have the
faculty of felling them where they want to
build, so as to save as much labor as possible.
At our left was a creek and a dam
they had built and a house they had constructed,
independent of the laws controlling
the builders' association or that of the
labor unions.</p>

<p>Their tools are very simple, as they use
their teeth for saws, their tails for trowels,
etc. In the midst of the dam was the
hut, built of unplaned logs, with a well-constructed
roof.</p>

<p>Under less favorable circumstances than
is found for animal life in the Park, these little
workers with their soft, silken fur would
have been hunted down and captured before
they could have brought the work to completion.
Again, I could not help but exclaim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
What a blessing are the laws governing the
Yellowstone Park!</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">&nbsp;</a></span>

<span class="caption">BEAVER DAM © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>The rangers, with stations interspersed
throughout the vast area of more than
3,000 square miles, are employed by the
government for the protection of life and
property, and arrests are quickly made and
penalties fixed when there is any violation of
the law. These men are not soldiers, but patrolmen
on horseback, dressed in cowboy's uniform.
An ordinary soldier would be unfitted
for such work. Men in leather shaps are
needed who can break and ride bronchos,
throw the lariat, and round up the herds;
those who are used to the mountain fastnesses
and the buffalo path, the haunts of
black, brown, and grizzly bears, and are acquainted
with the habits of the elk, moose,
mountain sheep, the antelope, the deer, etc.;
those who know the habits and lurking places
of the unscrupulous hunters and poachers who
defy the laws and by any or all means seek to
evade punishment. No one is better fitted
than the western ranger to track them down
and see that they are brought to justice.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the <span class="smcap">Mammoth
Springs</span>, we found a welcome at the camp and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
soon felt very much at home. It was cool
enough for a fire, and many of the tourists
gathered around the stove in the office and
chatted with one another until the evening
meal, which proved to be a plentiful repast and
well served.</p>

<p>Our tents were furnished after the same
pattern as those of the Grand Canyon Camp,
with the exception that these were lighted with
electricity.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Mammoth Hot Springs</span> and the beautiful
terraces, in attempting description of
which all language has been exhausted, were
only a short distance from the camp; without
waiting for a guide, we were soon winding
our way up the side of the hill and around
the road where we could find an entrance
to the plateau. I had seen pictures of the
many springs and terraces in colors, and
had supposed they were overdrawn, but I
found myself in the same bewildered state
as when I first saw the Grand Canyon.
Before I was aware, my tears were flowing
freely at the thought of how impossible it
would be to describe these springs to my
friends and others who, perhaps, would never
have the opportunity of seeing them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
blending of colors cannot be reproduced by
the brush of the most gifted artist. I was
thankful that God had permitted me to see the
work of His hands that I might help others in
the battle for eternal life.</p>

<p>Some of our party were looking for the
<span class="smcap">Devil's Kitchen</span>, but in the absence of a
guide were having difficulty in finding it;
I had no inclination to participate in the
search. I had been in the ante-chamber of
heaven and at the gates of perdition, and this
was sufficient for one day, so I started back
toward the camp, with a lady who seemed to
be satisfied to stay by my side, even though
she missed seeing many of the places of interest.</p>

<p>I knew she was tired, and hoped that she
might ride the remainder of the way. Soon
an automobile came along and took her
in. By this time my brother and sister and
other members of the party had given up the
search for the Devil's Kitchen and overtaken
us. Later I was told that it is in the crater
of an extinct boiling spring, not far from
some of the terraces.</p>

<p>After reaching the camp, I was about to
retire, when I decided to go to the office and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
see what was going on. A number of persons
were preparing a program for an entertainment,
and asked me to make an address,
but I felt that enough had been crowded into
one day, and declined.</p>

<p>Before morning, the weather became very
chilly, and I had to use both the heavy comforters
that had been provided for my bed.
My circulation was not good, and my rest was
more or less disturbed. I feared a greater
change might come in the weather, and decided
to get over the ground as quickly as possible
even though we should have to miss
many of the details of the place.</p>

<p>We had breakfast with Mr. Hayes, president
of the Yellowstone Camp Company, who
officially, or otherwise, has been connected
with operations in the Yellowstone for the
past twenty-five years. Mr. Hayes was able
to give us some valuable information, which
we greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mammoth Camp</span> is situated at the foot of
Jupiter Terrace. A short distance away is
Fort Yellowstone, where the administration
headquarters of the Park is located.</p>

<p>I should have enjoyed seeing more of the
springs, with their gorgeous hues and combinations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
but with the hope that we should have
the opportunity of visiting the Park again in
the near future, our party took the morning
stage to Old Faithful Camp, at the Upper Geyser
Basin.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_069.jpg" width="600" height="451" alt="FORT YELLOWSTONE" title="FORT YELLOWSTONE" />
<span class="caption">FORT YELLOWSTONE © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>Before leaving, I got a glimpse of the
buffalo herd on the horizon in the distance,
and was surprised to hear how rapidly these
animals are becoming extinct in the Park,
where they are so well protected. It seems
that the buffalo and the Indian go together,
and thrive only where civilization has not yet
come.</p>

<p>The weather was cold, and having to travel
in an open car made it very uncomfortable until
the sun had time to rise above the tall trees
and the mountain peaks. A brisk wind was
blowing, and most of the time I had to keep
my face heavily veiled. This hindered me
from getting the full benefit of the scenery on
the way to the Norris Geyser Basin. Here,
however, there was so much steam and boiling
water I had no difficulty in getting warm.</p>

<p>We had a skilful driver, who called out
the names of the places in a clear voice. This
kept the passengers from being under a strain
of uncertainty and tense listening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><span class="smcap">Obsidian Cliff</span>, formed as the result of
volcanic action in ages past, is twelve miles
south of Mammoth Hot Springs. It rises two
hundred fifty feet above the road and is composed
of jet-black, volcanic glass, usually
opaque, streaked with red, yellow, and green.
When the roadway was constructed, great
fires were built around blocks of this glass,
which, when heated, were cooled by dashing
water upon them resulting in their being shattered
into fragments. This is said to be the
only stretch of glass road in existence.</p>

<p>The cliff was "neutral ground" to the
different tribes of Indians. Chips of obsidian
and partly finished obsidian arrow-heads are
found throughout the Park, usually at places
where the Indians had their camps. When the
cliff is illuminated by the rays of the sun, it
has the appearance of a glistening mirror, and
is of much interest to the tourists.</p>

<p>Four and one-half miles from Norris is
<span class="smcap">Roaring Mountain</span> with steam escaping
through countless apertures from its rugged
side. The sound of the steam struggling to
escape is not so audible now as in the past, but
the whole picture reminds one of the inferno
about ready to blow off its cap.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">&nbsp;</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_072.jpg" width="600" height="465" alt="OBSIDIAN CLIFF" title="OBSIDIAN CLIFF" />
<span class="caption">OBSIDIAN CLIFF © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>In close proximity to the mountain are
greenish, milky pools fed by rivers of sulphur
water from the springs. It was not our privilege
to tarry here, from the fact that the
weather was uncomfortably cold, but the
mountain stands out before me as one of the
most interesting places to be seen on the tour.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing fiercely when we
came to <span class="smcap">Twin Lakes</span>, four miles from Norris
Geyser Basin, but I removed my heavy veil
in order to get a better glimpse of them. They
are beautiful, and although in such close proximity,
their hues are entirely different.</p>

<p>How often two objects are found so
closely allied to each other as to be inseparable,
each one depending upon the other for
its existence! This cannot be a freak of nature
or the result of chance. The only sensible
conclusion is that it was so designed by the
Creator to teach a most important spiritual
lesson,&mdash;that of the two works of grace, which
constitute the panoply of the soul. There is no
way to discard either without serious results.</p>

<p>There is something about clear, pure water,
whether it is seen in the placid lake or the
gushing, mountain torrent, that inspires and
lifts a person above the toils and cares of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
life, where he is able to breathe a pure
and holy atmosphere. Hence we see why, as
shown in the Scriptures, Jesus so often used
water to illustrate the plan of salvation.
Water is the symbol of life, and in the boiling
springs, the pools, the lakes, the chasms,
and the great, spouting geysers, a book is written
in the Yellowstone that every one should
learn to read.</p>

<p>Our attention was next called to the <span class="smcap">Frying
Pan</span>, a basin fifteen feet across, with numerous
boiling jets in constant and violent agitation.</p>

<p>I regretted that circumstances were not
more favorable so that I could have a longer
period of time to spend at these places, where
Nature is so full of life and interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>NORRIS GEYSER BASIN</h3>


<p>When we arrived at <span class="smcap">Norris</span> (formerly
Gibbon) <span class="smcap">Geyser Basin</span>, I was so cold
I could scarcely use my limbs. The
first attraction was a great, boiling spring at
the left as we entered the basin. I immediately
felt the change in the atmosphere, and
soon got warm after reaching the board walk
under which the boiling water was flowing,
the hot steam everywhere being forced out
through apertures.</p>

<p>Here was my first sight of the clear water
geysers. The <span class="smcap">Constant</span>, with a maximum
height of twenty feet, plays at intervals of
from thirty to sixty seconds. The <span class="smcap">Minute
Man</span> plays at intervals of from one to three
minutes with a duration of about the same
length of time. In this basin are also the
<span class="smcap">Echinus</span>, the <span class="smcap">Fearless</span>, the <span class="smcap">Monarch</span>, with a
maximum height of fifty feet, playing at intervals
of twenty-five to sixty minutes, the
<span class="smcap">New Crater</span>, the <span class="smcap">Whirligig</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
The maximum height of the Valentine
is a hundred feet and the time of eruptions
varies from twenty-two to thirty hours.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Black Growler Steam Vent</span> growled
continually, sending forth great volumes of
steam. The deposit around the crater is black
in some places. The vent north of the Black
Growler is called the <span class="smcap">Hurricane</span>. It looks
much like the former, but is not so active. The
<span class="smcap">Bath Tub</span> does not erupt, but is in constant
agitation. <span class="smcap">Emerald Pool</span> is a large lake of
boiling water, green in appearance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Crater Geyser</span> is surrounded by large
blocks of yellow rock. In the vicinity of this
geyser, in 1891, a commotion occurred, very
much like an earthquake, when great volumes
of water were forced out. Since then there
have been only ordinary eruptions, about every
three minutes. The form of the crater is
such that the water is prevented from attaining
any great height.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monarch Geyser</span>, near the base of the hill,
is almost surrounded by beautifully colored
rocks. The crater has two openings, the
larger of which is twenty feet long and three
feet wide. Eruptions occur without warning,
and water is thrown a hundred feet high. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
intervals between eruptions are about six hours.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">&nbsp;</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_078.jpg" width="600" height="203" alt="NORRIS GEYSER BASIN" title="NORRIS GEYSER BASIN" />
<span class="caption">NORRIS GEYSER BASIN © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fearless Geyser</span> throws water in
every direction, apparently defying those who
wish to approach it. <span class="smcap">Norris</span> is a new geyser,
and is probably changing more rapidly than
any other in the basin. One never knows what
changes a season may bring forth.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Minute Man</span> is always interesting, especially
on account of its regularity. Its crater
seems originally to have been merely a
fissure in a rock.</p>

<p>A few miles from Norris Basin is <span class="smcap">Elk
Park</span>, a valley surrounded by timbered hills.
Across the river from the road is <span class="smcap">Chocolate
Spring</span>, which has built a cone of chocolate
color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monument Geyser Basin</span> is on the summit
of <span class="smcap">Mt. Schurz</span>. There is not much to justify
the tourist in making the ascent, as there
are only a dozen or two of crumbling geyser
cones, some of which steam and rumble, while
others are apparently extinct.</p>

<p>On the east side of the river we entered
<span class="smcap">Gibbon Canyon</span>, and for several miles were
shadowed by towering cliffs, in some places a
thousand feet high.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beryl Spring</span> is the largest boiling spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
in the canyon. It is fifteen feet across, and
about a mile from the entrance. While our
touring car was dashing around the mountainside,
suddenly we came to <span class="smcap">Gibbon Fall</span>.
Here, from a height of over eighty feet, bubbling
and foaming torrents of water tumble
down the steep cascades.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">National Park Mountain</span>, our driver
announced that we were at the confluence of
the Gibbon and Firehole Rivers. It was here
that the famous Washburn exploring party,
in 1870, decided that the Yellowstone region
should be set aside as a National Park,
and from that time put forth their efforts to
this end. Among the most enthusiastic were
Cornelius Hedges, David E. Folsom, Lieut.
Doane, and Nathaniel P. Langford. How
providential it was that these unselfish, public-spirited
men should have taken up the subject
at that time!</p>

<p>I did not know that the junction of the
Gibbon and Firehole Rivers was an historical
place, but was so fascinated with the scenery, I
felt that I should like to camp there for a week,
and have an opportunity to make notes preparatory
to publishing an account of my trip.
To me, there was unusual attraction, and something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
very romantic, about the Firehole River.
I had heard how it was fed by the geysers and
boiling springs, and this added enchantment
to its many charms. At one place I saw a
great boulder in the river, from the sides of
which were growing two spruce or pine trees.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">&nbsp;</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_081.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="NATIONAL PARK MOUNTAIN" title="NATIONAL PARK MOUNTAIN" />
<span class="caption">NATIONAL PARK MOUNTAIN © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>At the <span class="smcap">Lower</span> and <span class="smcap">Midway Basins</span> are the
<span class="smcap">Great Fountain</span> and <span class="smcap">Excelsior Geysers</span>.
The Excelsior, better known as "Hell's Half
Acre," ceased to play in 1888. Previous to this
it was known to throw water to a height of
300 feet, the time of the eruptions varying
from one to four hours. <span class="smcap">Great Fountain</span> expels the
water to a height of 100 feet, playing
for thirty minutes, and its eruptions are from
eight to twelve hours apart. At the present
time Excelsior Geyser is a boiling lake, where
the steam often prevents one from getting a
good view of it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Mammoth Paint Pots</span> held my undivided
interest for the limited time that I had.
This is a boiling mass of mud, white at the center,
and gradually developing into a beautiful
pink, or flesh color toward the outer edges.
The caldron of waxen mixture has a basin
forty by sixty feet in size, with a rim about five
feet high. The mud in the center bubbles up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
continually, "plop, plop," under the pressure of
heat, and cools off toward the outer edges.</p>

<p>David E. Folsom witnessed a display of
the Great Fountain Geyser in 1869:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The hole through which the water was discharged
was ten feet in diameter, and was situated in the center
of a large circular shallow basin into which the
water fell. There was a stiff breeze blowing at the
time, and by going to the windward side and carefully
picking our way over convenient stones we
were enabled to reach the edge of the hole. At that
moment the escaping steam was causing the water to
boil up in a fountain five or six feet high. It stopped
in an instant, and commenced settling down&mdash;twenty,
thirty, forty feet&mdash;until we concluded that the bottom
had fallen out, but the next instant, without any
warning, it came rushing up and shot into the air at
least eighty feet, causing us to stampede. It continued
to spout at intervals of a few moments for some
time, but finally subsided."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Prismatic Lake</span> fairly dazzled me with its
beauty. In the center it is a deep blue, blending
into green toward the edges. In the shallow
portion it is yellow, blending into orange
at the edges. The water sparkles and flows
off in every direction over the slightly raised
rim of the lake. Its beauty and delicacy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
coloring are impossible to describe. It is
heated to nearly 150 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biscuit Basin</span> and <span class="smcap">Sapphire Pool</span> are
places of much interest, also <span class="smcap">Jewel Geyser</span>,
<span class="smcap">Artemisia Geyser</span>, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morning Glory Spring</span>, near Riverside
Bridge, presented to me an idea of what
the earth will be when the curse is lifted and it
is clothed in Edenic glory. It is twenty-three
feet in diameter, with a temperature of 100
degrees Fahrenheit, and with an apparent
depth of about thirty feet.</p>

<p>I had not previously made a study of the
Park, and never knew what was coming next,
but before I reached Old Faithful Camp at the
Upper Geyser Basin, I felt that I had seen
enough to repay me a thousand-fold for any
expense or effort that was being made in the
tour of the Yellowstone, which to me was truly
a world of wonders.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>UPPER GEYSER BASIN</h3>


<p>It was about noon when we reached the
<span class="smcap">Upper Geyser Basin</span>, and I felt that it
would be profitable to take a little rest before
going any further into the mysteries of this
"wonderland." <span class="smcap">Old Faithful</span> was due to play
shortly after we reached the camp, but I was
too far away when it was announced she was
in action to get the full benefit of the display,
and went back to the camp to wait another
seventy minutes. The long drive in the forenoon,
and the exposure to the cold, caused me
to feel weary and dull, nevertheless I made an
effort to be on hand at every eruption, which
to me became more and more fascinating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Faithful Inn</span> accommodates 400
guests. It is constructed of boulders and logs,
with peaks, angles, dormers, French windows,
etc. This most restful and impressive abode
of the tourists is only two or three minutes'
walk from Old Faithful Geyser, and so located<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
as to give from its balconies a splendid
view of the display.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">&nbsp;</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_088.jpg" width="600" height="467" alt="OFFICE OLD FAITHFUL INN" title="OFFICE OLD FAITHFUL INN" />
<span class="caption">OFFICE OLD FAITHFUL INN   © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>The office-room is 75 feet square and 92
feet high, and reaches to the roof, with a massive
chimney that rises to the top. The building
is surrounded with beautiful grounds,
furnished with rustic seats. The chimney
is fourteen feet square with eight fireplaces,
and balconies are built around three sides.
While everything is of the rustic order,
there is nothing commonplace about the
hotel or its furnishings. "It is a creation of
art from the foundation to the peak of the
roof."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Faithful Geyser</span> in the forefront
of Old Faithful Inn is like a sentinel, and so
named because of the regularity of its eruptions.
Its crater, from which the water is expelled
to a height of 150 feet, is an oblong
opening, two by six feet, at the top of a mound
of geyserite. Its eruptions sometimes vary a
few minutes, in the meantime giving warning
with two or three short spurts, increasing in
volume until the maximum height is reached.
The display is short, most of the water falling
back into the crater, but no more fascinating
or impressive scene could be found. The formations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
around are brilliant in color, resembling
the more subdued tints and hues seen at
the Mammoth Hot Springs.</p>

<p>In the early part of the afternoon, a number
of tourists, including my brother and sister,
went with a guide to <span class="smcap">Geyser Hill</span>.
After their return, they had much to say
about what they had seen and heard. Later
in the day I felt rested and wanted to make
the trip, and my brother and sister went with
me. They had learned all they could from
the guide and were ready to name the various
geysers, springs, and pools, and describe their
operations to me. Of these, the Giantess,
Beehive, and Sponge Geysers, were the most
interesting. The <span class="smcap">Giantess</span> occupies the most
prominent position on the hill. Its displays
attain a height of about 100 feet, and are accompanied
by shocks and tremors much like
earthquakes. The entire eruption lasts from
twelve to twenty-four hours. The crater appears
to be about thirty feet in diameter, and
after each eruption a steam period ensues. In
1911, the eruptions varied from four to twelve
days. Some years previous to this, the eruptions
took place about once a month. It is believed
that while activity, as a whole, is decreasing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the geyser regions, a century brings only a
slight change.</p>

<p>I stood near the crater of the Giantess during
the steam period. For a moment the vapor
cleared away, and I could see down the great
neck of the crater into a yawning chasm, so
angry and terrible, as to make me feel that
I had seen with the eye what the Bible describes
as the bottomless pit, where the sulphurous
flames belch forth, and "where their worm
dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" (Mark
9:44).</p>

<p>If there are those who have doubts as to
the reality of the lake of fire, of which Jesus
told His disciples, in the 16th chapter of St.
Luke, they should by all means go to the regions
of the Yellowstone: for here, vividly presented
to the vision, are the realities of a burning
underworld, with only a thin crust between
it and the habitation of human beings.</p>

<p>The Bible clearly teaches that hell is located
in the center of this earth, and therefore
it must be conceded that the ebon throne of
Diabolus is somewhere in the heated regions
below, the intensity of which the geysers,
pools, springs, and volcanoes are continually
demonstrating.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 449px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">&nbsp;</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_092.jpg" width="449" height="600" alt="GIANTESS GEYSER IN ACTION" title="GIANTESS GEYSER IN ACTION" />
<span class="caption">GIANTESS GEYSER IN ACTION © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Whatever may be involved in the separation
of soul and body, it is nevertheless true
that the immortal spirit that has not appropriated
the atoning blood must dwell in the confines
of the bottomless pit, which is described
in the Scriptures as being in the center of this
earth. Here are the flames by which Dives
was tormented when he begged Abraham
to send Lazarus with a drop of water
to cool his parched tongue, and made an appeal
for some one to go to his father's house
to warn his five brothers not to come to that
place of torment. Abraham had to refuse
both requests, saying, "Son, remember that
thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things,
and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is
comforted, and thou art tormented. And beside
all this, between us and you there is a great
gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from
hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to
us, that would come from thence." Then,
when he wanted some one to go to his father's
house to warn his brothers, Abraham said,
"They have Moses and the prophets; let them
hear them." But still the doomed man continued
and said, "If one went unto them from
the dead, they will repent," but he was told, "If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither
will they be persuaded, though one rose from
the dead." How true this is! After all the
influence that can be brought to bear upon
people, they rebel against God and follow their
own precepts; and true to fallen human nature,
ask for greater evidence of His power.
"The wicked shall be turned into hell, and
all the nations that forget God" (Ps. 9:17).
This and other plain scriptures should be
sufficient to warn men to flee the wrath to
come. Optimism and presumption everywhere
characterize the multitudes when it
comes to this most important question concerning
the future welfare of the soul.</p>

<p>The man who had allowed the devil to deceive
him and take him at last to his abode in
the regions of torment, was still presumptuous
and persistent. He wanted help, which it was
impossible for him to receive, and also warning
given to his father's house, which they had refused
to take through Moses and the
prophets.</p>

<p>It is necessary at this period of the world's
history to have an object lesson like that of the
Yellowstone National Park to convince people
of the infallibility of God's word. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
time of the fulfilment of prophecy concerning
the last days, of which Paul says,</p>

<p>"This know also, that in the last days perilous
times shall come. For men shall be lovers
of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
unholy, Without natural affection, truce-breakers,
false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers
of those that are good, Traitors, heady,
highminded, LOVERS OF PLEASURES
MORE THAN LOVERS OF GOD" (2 Tim.
3:1-5).</p>

<p>Many pleasure seekers are now thronging
Yellowstone Park, and in ten thousand demonstrations
are having to face the realities
of God's word and the life that is to come. I
saw some of them standing near the yawning
craters of the geysers under deep conviction,
and no doubt silently resolving to live different
lives, while others frankly stated that the
depths of their beings had been disturbed, and
that it was no time to trifle with the soul.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as shirking the responsibility,
where Nature co-operates with
the Almighty on such a tremendous scale in
the display of His power. A person may try
to stifle his conscience and refuse to yield to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the voice that speaks from above, but he can
not evade the fact that the issue must be
met; and why not yield to the pressure and
make the decision now? Life at best is short,
and it is perilous to crowd into some future
time the things that should be taken under consideration
now.</p>

<span class="caption">THE SPONGE GEYSER © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Teakettle</span> and the <span class="smcap">Vault</span> give warning
before the Giantess erupts. The Vault
plays eight feet high, twenty-four hours before
the Giantess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topaz</span> at the base of the Giantess mound
is a pool of remarkable beauty. I was much
interested in the <span class="smcap">Pump</span> near the Sponge Geyser.
It is a hole eighteen inches across, out of
which comes a thumping sound, resembling a
hydraulic ram.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sponge Geyser</span> has a beautiful cone
of flinty formation resembling that of a
sponge. Eruptions are about four feet high,
occuring a minute and a quarter apart.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Beehive Geyser</span> has a cone four feet
high and three feet across, and plays to the
height of 200 feet. Its indicator, a small fissure
north of the cone, foretells its eruptions.
It is supposed that there is some relationship
between the Beehive and the Giantess from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the fact that the Beehive plays at intervals of
from eight to twelve hours after the Giantess
and has been seen to play before the Giantess.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 462px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">&nbsp;</a></span>

<span class="caption">THE BEEHIVE GEYSER © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Doublet Pool</span> is near the Giantess
and is marked "Dangerous." The geyser formations
accumulate very slowly and the water
here flows out over a thin crust.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lion Geyser</span>, with the <span class="smcap">Lioness</span> and
two <span class="smcap">Cubs</span>, occupies a prominent place not far
from the Giant. Its eruptions occur usually in
series of three, about two and one-half hours
apart, after which follows a quiet period of
about twelve hours. The first eruption is the
highest and most charming in appearance.
The water is forced up fifty or sixty feet high,
the eruption lasting about five minutes.</p>

<p>During some seasons the Lioness has not
played at all. In 1903 it is said that the Lioness
and both Cubs played at the same time to
a large party of tourists. The larger Cub
plays with the Lioness to a height of about
thirty feet, the smaller one plays oftener, but
only a few feet high.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castle Geyser</span> is on a prominence opposite
Geyser Hill. The mound on which it is
situated covers about three acres, rising
more than forty feet above the river. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the most prominent cone in the Upper Basin,
resembling an old castle. At intervals the
steam escapes and throws out jets of water,
though it erupts only every two days. Near
Castle Geyser is <span class="smcap">Castle Spring</span>, a beautiful
pool of water, highly colored.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sawmill Geyser</span> gets its name from
the peculiar noise it makes during an eruption.
It plays at intervals of three or four hours and
at a height of about forty feet. Its indicator
is near-by; they both start together and
suddenly begin to throw water in all directions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Grand Geyser</span> discharges water in
forked columns 200 feet high. It is said to
play much more frequently in the spring than
in the fall. This is because the water supply
is greater in the mountain regions at this season.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turban Geyser</span> is near the Grand. The
early explorers believed that internal fires
were seen in its crater; if so, it was caused, no
doubt, by the light playing on bubbles of gas.
Firehole Lake furnishes a good example of
this phenomenon. The Turban Geyser plays
about twenty-five feet high. Sometimes its
eruptions occur with the Grand Geyser.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Economic Geyser</span> gets its name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
from the fact that during its eruptions nearly
all the water flows back into its crater. In
form it resembles Old Faithful, but plays only
about fifteen feet high.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">&nbsp;</a></span>

<span class="caption">CASTLE GEYSER © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beauty Spring</span> attracts much attention.
It is a large, silent pool remarkable for its coloring.
Almost every person, when approaching
it for the first time, remarks about its beauty,
hence, our guide said, it received its name. A
rusty color predominates in various shades
from the richest brown, blending into green
and yellow tints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Butterfly Spring</span> is about four feet
across and has an opening in each wing. It
looks like a butterfly in both color and shape.
These double springs, of which I saw a number,
as heretofore stated, have a spiritual significance,
illustrating the two works of grace,
justification and sanctification, so clearly taught
in both the Old and the New Testament.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ear</span> is a most remarkable small
spring. Not only is it in the shape of an ear,
but its lobe seems to be pierced, and the earring
is a tiny geyser. "It is here that messages
are transmitted, so the story goes, to regions
below."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beach Spring</span> reminded me of an oyster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the opening in the center corresponding
to the dark spot. It is surrounded by a flat,
submerged beach.</p>

<p>After we had visited the springs and geysers
on the hill, we returned to the camp to
await the next number on the day's program.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>UPPER GEYSER BASIN (CONT.)</h3>


<p>Shortly after dinner the news was circulated
that a religious service was to be
held in the office of the camp, where the
guests assembled around the large fireplace. I
learned from some friends that our party was
expected to conduct the meeting. Later, the
manager asked me to take charge of the service.
She said that it would be impossible to get the
people in until after 8:30 o'clock, as Old Faithful
would be due to make a display about that
time, and that the great searchlight from the
hotel would be turned on the geyser when the
water reached its maximum height. This
caused much excitement among the guests,
and every person sought the best position to
get a view of the display.</p>

<p>Immediately afterward the people gathered
in for the service. Song books were passed
around and a lively interest was taken in the
singing, in which nearly every one joined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
My brother and his wife sang a number of
pieces together which greatly pleased the audience.
My brother then preached a short sermon
and I followed, giving them some interesting
history concerning the Pillar of Fire
church. This seemed to be the subject in
which most of them were interested, and I was
glad to be able to give them the information
they desired. There is so much akin to the supernatural
in the Yellowstone it made the
preaching of the Gospel easy on this occasion.</p>

<p>The day, after having been full of interest
and inspiration, closed with a message of
salvation for the people, which was best of all.
Many gathered around us to express their appreciation
of the service.</p>

<p>The next morning I arose refreshed and
ready to finish the tour of the Upper Geyser
Basin, which contains twenty-six geysers and
more than four hundred hot pools and springs.
A party of "hikers," with a guide, started out
about nine o'clock to make the rounds before
luncheon. I was not quite sure that I could
keep up with them, but as many of the places
are not accessible to vehicles I had to make the
attempt or miss my opportunity.</p>

<p>The basin is drained in the center by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Firehole River. Everywhere steaming hot
springs are seen, also mounds and cones of
geyserite. In this basin, within a square mile,
are the grandest and mightiest geysers in the
world. There are pools of scalding water
whose marvelous beauty and delicacy of coloring
cannot be described. Everywhere are undulations
crowned with geyser cones, or hot
spring vents of a grayish white appearance.
In places, the earth trembles, strange rumblings
are heard, and the air is heavy with sulphurous
fumes. How could it be otherwise
but that a person should feel that he is in close
proximity to the Inferno which Dante so vividly
described!</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Riverside Geyser</span>, on the banks of the
Firehole River, plays, we were told, "Over the
River" at intervals of six or seven hours.
Sometimes eruptions occur more frequently
for a period of several days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grotto Geyser</span> has the most attractive
formation of any geyser in the park. The
Washburn party named it in 1870. Its eruptions
are irregular, occurring at intervals of
two to eight hours and lasting from fifteen minutes
to eight hours. Sometimes the Grotto
ceases and the <span class="smcap">Rocket</span> plays to a height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
fifty feet. After it has ceased, the Grotto resumes
action.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 466px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">&nbsp;</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_108.jpg" width="466" height="600" alt="RIVERSIDE GEYSER" title="RIVERSIDE GEYSER" />
<span class="caption">RIVERSIDE GEYSER © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Giant Geyser</span>, south of the Grotto,
is the highest in the world. We found a
person near it in soldier's uniform who said
he had been waiting there a week to see it
play. Its maximum height is 250 feet, which
is reached during the first twenty minutes of
its eruption. Its cone is ten feet high with
one side partly broken off. Eruptions occur
every seven to twelve days.</p>

<p>Near the Giant are three "boiling caldrons,"
<span class="smcap">Catfish</span>, <span class="smcap">Bijou</span>, and <span class="smcap">Mastiff</span>.
These are supposed to be indicators, but it is
uncertain whether the eruptions of the Giant
are foretold by them.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Daisy</span> is a very beautiful and reliable
geyser, erupting every one and a half to
two hours. Seventy-five feet is its maximum
height.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Bonita Pool</span>, across the road, acts as
an indicator.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Brilliant</span> is a beautiful blue hot
spring and near to it is the <span class="smcap">Comet</span>, which has
built up a small cone of geyserite.</p>

<p>When our party reached Castle Geyser on
a hill opposite the Giantess, our guide called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
attention to the fact that the Giantess was in
action. Our time was limited, but every member
of the party wanted to cross the bridge
and go to Geyser Hill and get as near to its
crater as possible. We did so, and it was at
this time, during the steam period, when the
water had receded, that I got a glimpse into
its awful depths; and trembled at the yawning
chasm which threatened to engulf us. It
looked as if it might be connected with the
place where the king of darkness dwells and
his organized forces operate. We had only
a few minutes to tarry, and hastened back to
the vicinity of Castle Geyser to renew the
journey.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 460px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">&nbsp;</a></span>

<span class="caption">GIANT GEYSER © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>I was grateful for this little diversion,
which broke in on the regular program of the
tour, feeling that I had been fortunate to see
at least one eruption from the crater of the
Giantess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morning-glory Spring</span>, or <span class="smcap">Geyser</span>, as it
is sometimes called, was to me the climax in
beauty of all the springs in the geyser basins.
It looked as if it might be a gem of Paradise
that had survived the curse. It appears to be
a mass of many-colored liquids, resembling a
giant morning-glory, hence its name.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE BOTTOMLESS PIT</h3>


<p>Proof is often asked for statements
made that hell is located in the center of
the earth. John, as recorded in the 20th
chapter of Revelation, said,</p>

<p>"And I saw an angel come down from
heaven, having the key of the BOTTOMLESS
PIT and a great chain in his hand. And he
laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which
is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand
years, And cast him into the BOTTOMLESS
PIT, and shut him up, and set a seal
upon him, that he should deceive the nations
no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled."</p>

<p>Where else could the bottomless pit be but
in the center of this earth, when it is implicitly
stated that the angel came down from
heaven with the chain to bind Satan? Ours
is the sphere for which he is contending and
where he has so long deceived the nations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Where else could the angel lock him up but on
the inside of the earth?</p>

<p>In the 16th chapter of Numbers we have
an account of Korah's company, who murmured
and rebelled against the Lord, and
Moses, in trying to show how great was their
crime against God, said,</p>

<p>"If these men die the common death of
all men, or if they be visited after the visitation
of all men; then the Lord hath not sent
me. But if the Lord make a new thing, and
the earth open her mouth, and swallow them
up, with all that appertain unto them, and they
go down quick into the PIT; then ye shall understand
that these men have provoked the
Lord.</p>

<p>"And it came to pass, as he had made an end
of speaking all these words, that the ground
clave asunder that was under them. And the
earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them
up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained
unto Korah, and all their goods.
They, and all that appertained to them, went
down alive into the PIT, and the earth closed
upon them: and they perished from among
the congregation. And all Israel that were
round about them fled at the cry of them: for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also."</p>

</div>

<p>In the first chapter of Job, we have an account
of a controversy between the Lord and
Satan. And the Lord said unto Satan,</p>

<p>"Whence comest thou?"</p>

<p>Then Satan answered, "From going to and
fro in the earth, and from walking up and
down in it."</p>

<p>The Lord asked Satan if he had considered
His servant Job, a perfect and an upright man,
one who "feareth God, and escheweth evil."</p>

<p>Satan, unwilling to admit Job's loyalty to
God, said,</p>

<p>"Hast not thou made an hedge about him,
... on every side? thou hast blessed the
work of his hands, and his substance is increased
in the land. But put forth thine hand
now, and touch all that he hath, and he will
curse thee to thy face."</p>

<p>The Lord took the challenge, and said,</p>

<p>"Behold, all that he hath is in thy power;
only upon himself put not forth thine hand."</p>

<p>It follows that calamity fell upon Job's
household, and he lost his sons and his daughters
and all that he had. And again Satan
presented himself before the Lord, after he
had lost in the battle with Job, who maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
his integrity through his afflictions, and
sinned not nor charged God foolishly.</p>

<p>The second time the Lord said unto Satan,</p>

<p>"Whence comest thou?"</p>

<p>And again the answer was, "From going to
and fro in the earth, and from walking up and
down in it."</p>

<p>Here is an admission from Satan himself
which proves without a doubt where he dwells;
and it is here that the mighty angel will capture
him and bind him with a great chain and lock
him up in the center of this earth for a thousand
years. It is comforting to know that
Job won in the second battle, after Satan had
afflicted him with boils from the soles of his
feet to the crown of his head, and so will
Satan be defeated at the closing up of this age,
when judgments shall fall upon the wicked, as
upon Korah's company, and great demonstrations
of God's power be seen and felt.</p>

<p>Jude speaks of the angels which kept not
their first estate, but left their own habitations
(that is, came down to earth) whom God "hath
reserved in everlasting chains under darkness
unto the judgment of the great day." He
also makes mention of the inhabitants of Sodom
and Gomorrah, suffering the vengeance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
eternal fire. These are but a few of the instances
mentioned in the Scriptures showing
the location of hell, which is the abode of the
wicked, and where Diabolus has his throne.</p>

<p>The impression that was made on the explorers
of the Yellowstone regions is indicated
by certain names that were given to some
places, such as "Devil's Kitchen," "Devil's
Frying Pan," "Black Growler," "Hell Broth
Springs," "Devil's Hoof," "Devil's Inkwell,"
"Hell's Half Acre," etc.</p>

<p>That the suggestion of these things should
be a mere freak, or fancy of the mind is out of
the question, when there is so much scriptural
proof to the contrary.</p>

<p>Man has been created in the image of God,
and a little lower than the angels (Heb. 2:7).
There is a voice that speaks to the soul
when all others are hushed. Intuitively he
knows that punishment awaits the wicked,
however much he may try to stifle his conscience
and evade the issue.</p>

<p>The only way to escape the wrath that is
to come, is through the atoning blood, the efficacy
of which is proved when conditions are
met. "Without shedding of blood is no remission"
(Heb. 9:22).</p>

<span class="caption">PUNCH BOWL © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>The <span class="smcap">Punch Bowl</span> is situated in a narrow
divide in the valley. Its rim is ornamented
with yellow, saffron, and red. It is one
of the gems of beauty in the upper basin,
and is so located as to revive the spirits of
those who, starting out on foot, from the Upper
Basin Camp and Old Faithful Inn, have grown
weary in making the tour. When our guide
called it out, I felt that I could go no farther
without resting, but after tarrying a few minutes,
and admiring its beauty, I was refreshed.
I was, perhaps, the only one in the company who
was overtaxed physically, and had to trust to
the good will of the guide not to leave me too
far behind. He kindly took notice, and halted,
giving everybody a few minutes to rest, while
he explained the scientific action of the geysers.</p>

<p>These beautiful springs in remote places
reminded me of the gems of salvation that are
obtained only through sacrifice and suffering.
There is always a price to be paid for anything
that is of worth. It cost me something to visit
some of them on foot, but I was well
paid. After leaving the Punch Bowl we followed
the trail down across the bridge where
a number of surprises awaited us. The
<span class="smcap">Handkerchief Pool</span>, which is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
called the <span class="smcap">Laundry</span>, was among them. We
threw our handkerchiefs in and they were
carried down into the opening, and then
brought back and delivered, as carefully as if
they were being handled by unseen hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 410px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">&nbsp;</a></span>

<span class="caption">HANDKERCHIEF POOL © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerald Pool</span> is not far from the
Handkerchief Spring, and is by far the most
beautiful in the upper basin. It thrilled me
as I looked at it from different angles, blending
from a deep green in the center to yellow
toward the edge. The formations around the
pool are red, the water is hot, but never boils,
and slightly overflows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cliff Spring</span> boils violently. Some people
call it a geyser, but it is supposed to be only
a spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Sand Spring</span> and <span class="smcap">Specimen Lake</span>
simply defy language in trying to describe them,
the coloring presents such remarkable varieties.
The extremely delicate pinks are mingled with
equally delicate tints of saffron and yellow,
with here and there shades of green.</p>

<p>While the springs in this neighborhood are
fascinating in the extreme, we did not tarry
long, as it was nearly noon, and our guide said
we would have to hasten.</p>

<p>When the party started toward Old Faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Inn and the camp, I decided to take my
time and go alone. I had gone only a short
distance through the wood when a harmless
snake crossed my path. It frightened me, and
I tried to kill it, but did not succeed. There
was a significance to me in running on to the
reptile; it settled something in my mind,
whereas I had not as yet been able to come to
a decision; and I took it as being among the all
things that work together for good to them
that love God and who are the called according
to His purpose.</p>

<p>On my way to the camp, I came to three
boiling pools, and was surprised that no mention
had been made of them on the tour.
Later, I learned that they were the <span class="smcap">Three
Sisters</span>, not far from Castle Geyser on the
road leading from Riverside Geyser, to Old
Faithful Inn.</p>

<p>I stopped at Haynes' Picture Shop. Here
I saw some marvelous specimens of art, showing
the wonders of the Yellowstone, but none,
of course, could do justice to what I had seen.</p>

<p>To finish up the tour it would take another
day, but our time was limited, and as we had
spent a day at Cody and the weather was getting
cool, we decided to leave in the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>Among some of the attractions that we
would have to miss in not finishing the tour to
Yellowstone Lake, were Kepler Cascade, Two
Ocean Pond, Moose Fall, and the Continental
Divide which extends from Canada to Mexico.</p>

<p>At the <span class="smcap">Thumb</span> there are several geyser
cones, springs, and paint pots. The <span class="smcap">Fishing
Cone</span> with a boiling spring in the center, is
surrounded by the cold water of the lake. At
one time fishermen, without moving out of their
tracks caught fish from the lake and swung
them into the spring where they were cooked
while still on the hook. This practice, however,
is now prohibited by law.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE VOICE OF GOD</h3>


<p>Thirty-four years ago, while teaching
school, I had an opportunity of
going to Yellowstone National Park
with a camping party of school teachers
and others from Southern Montana, but as
I needed money, I decided to teach a summer
school and to postpone the trip until
some future time. When the party returned
and tried to tell me about the many wonders
they had seen, I resolved not to lose another
opportunity to go, but I did, and for the same
reason that kept me from going before. After
this I was not so enthusiastic over the Yellowstone
and the many miracles to be seen there.</p>

<p>However, I was always interested in some
of the descriptions of the geysers,&mdash;Old Faithful,
the Giant, Giantess, and others, that threw
boiling water, at intervals, from 150 to 250 feet
into the air. In Gospel messages I used them
to illustrate spiritual truths, but no one had
ever given me the slightest conception of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Grand Canyon, the Upper and Lower Yellowstone
Falls, the boiling pools, the paint pots,
the cascades, Mammoth Hot Springs, the exquisite
colorings of the mineral formations,
Roaring Mountain, "Hell's Half Acre," the
majestic mountain peaks and ranges, Rainbow
Lake, the Punch Bowl, Amethyst Spring, and
a thousand other things which so awed and inspired
me that out of the depths of my being, I
exclaimed, "What is man, that thou art mindful
of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest
him? For thou hast made him a little lower
than the angels, and hast crowned him with
glory and honor. Thou madest him to have
dominion over the works of thy hands; thou
hast put all things under his feet."</p>

<p>But how unworthy has he proved to be!
Amidst the magnificence and grandeur of the
wonders of Nature, he is ever showing his ingratitude,
and the tendency to prostitute these
things to the uses of his baser nature, and take
all the glory to himself. He makes use of the
gold and silver to build himself a habitation
that storms are destined to shatter, leaving
him exposed to divine wrath.</p>

<p>As I meditated upon these things, my
heart cried out, "Who shall ascend into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand
in his holy place? He that hath clean hands,
and a pure heart; ... He shall receive
the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness
from the God of his salvation" (Ps. 24:3-5).
My heart overflowed like the boiling springs
and the gushing geysers, which symbolize the
sanctified life.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">&nbsp;</a></span>

<span class="caption">JUPITER TERRACE © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>When I first had opportunity to go to Yellowstone
Park, I did not enjoy the experience
of sanctification, and therefore could not have
appreciated its many wonders as I do now.
Who knows but this is the reason why the door
closed and did not open for me to go until I
should be in the enjoyment of this experience,
and able to impart spiritual truths to others?</p>

<p>There is an inner chamber of the soul that
corresponds to the hill of the Lord. It is the
place where the Shekinah dwells and His secrets
are made manifest. Those who know
Him in the relationship of the Bride can better
appreciate His handiwork. Submission to
the whole will of God is the price of such an
experience.</p>

<p>There are those who appreciate the grandeur
and magnificence of the Yellowstone as
a whole, but there are thousands of spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
lessons which the book of nature unfolds
that the ordinary sightseer fails to grasp.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">&nbsp;</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_130.jpg" width="600" height="469" alt="BUFFALO HERD" title="BUFFALO HERD" />
<span class="caption">BUFFALO HERD © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>At one place, there are two openings in
a pool, or two springs so close together that
they are called <span class="smcap">The Goggles</span>. Here again
the two works of grace are beautifully set
forth. Our guide illustrated some love affair
by the two springs to the amusement of the
young people in the company, but inadvertently
my mind turned to the deeper spiritual truths
of which they furnish a splendid example.</p>

<p>It takes the Holy Spirit to read God in
nature as much as it does to interpret His word.
Jesus said, "But the Comforter, which is the
Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
name, he shall teach you all things, and bring
all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I
have said unto you." Also, "Howbeit when
he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide
you into all truth; ... and he will shew you
things to come" (John 16:13).</p>

<p>The two springs, to me, represented Justification
and Sanctification,&mdash;the two works of
grace in the atonement, without which the soul
is exposed to the wrath of God. It is the office
work of the Holy Spirit to reveal Jesus to
the heart and to act in the capacity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Comforter, but when He takes possession He
cleanses and purifies His temple. This is
done when the heart is sanctified wholly. It
is thenceforth the abiding place of the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p>I could not help but think of what it shall
be when the earth shall be rent, the mountains
removed from their places, and men shall cry
for the rocks and hills to fall upon them to
hide them from the presence of Him that sitteth
on the throne. There is no fear where
the Holy Spirit is the abiding Guest. The
rocks may rend and the earth be removed out
of its place, but peace will flow like a river.</p>

<p>Those who are so fortunate as to see the
wonders of the Yellowstone will either soften
or harden as the result of coming in touch
with that which is so closely allied to the supernatural.
It is like the melting influence of the
Holy Spirit under a Gospel message when men
are compelled to make their decision for
eternity. God forbid that they should harden.
If so, what could awaken them to their danger?
The great war that has so recently terminated,
bringing so much suffering and sacrifice, has
made people better or worse. It has been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
blessing or a curse, and so will the geyser region
be to those who visit it.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">&nbsp;</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_133.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="ELK STALLED IN SNOW" title="ELK STALLED IN SNOW" />
<span class="caption">ELK STALLED IN SNOW © Haynes, St. Paul</span>
</div>

<p>Should there be those who pass by the wonders
of the Yellowstone with cold indifference
and a lack of response to what is seen there, it
is proof that the world has already played
havoc with their finer sensibilities, and as a result
of this hardening process the mind and
heart refuse to yield when brought under the
strongest moral and spiritual influences. May
God save people from such a calamity,&mdash;from
becoming clay that is irresponsive to the divine
touch. May they learn to magnify His
name while suspended by the brittle thread of
life over a yawning chasm of burning lava
which is threatening to engulf them. Should
man not be prepared for the great event
that must come to everyone, there will be no
one to blame but himself. God has made him a
free moral agent, capable of choosing between
right and wrong. If he should make the
wrong decision, he will have to abide by the
consequences.</p>

<p>How many tourists will see the spring
called the Ear and yet fail to hear the voice of
God speaking to the soul through its many
beauties! How many fail to hear Him speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
through the great subterranean channels
hundreds of feet below the surface, thundering
the terrors of a broken law and heralding
the news of His impending judgments!</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">&nbsp;</a></span>
<img src="images/illo_135.jpg" width="600" height="452" alt="GOLDEN GATE CANYON AND VIADUCT" title="GOLDEN GATE CANYON AND VIADUCT" />
<span class="caption">GOLDEN GATE CANYON AND VIADUCT</span>
</div>

<p>A great author said, "O woman, thy name
is frailty." The many short-comings of the
gentler sex provoked this expression, but does
not the word frailty equally apply to every individual
on whom the curse has fallen? There
is ever a downward tendency and a proneness
to place the affections on material things, to
worship the creature rather than the Creator.</p>

<p>It is with much difficulty that tourists in the
Yellowstone are prevented from defacing the
formations around the geysers, which have
been centuries in making. There are those
who would pay almost any price to be permitted
to carry away souvenirs, but if they
were allowed to do so one can readily see what
the consequence would be. Of what use are
pieces of geyserite when taken away from their
natural environment? It would be impossible
to form an opinion as to what they represent.
Likewise there are those who are satisfied
with mere forms of religion,&mdash;baptism, church
membership, or any substitute for real salvation.
What knowledge would a piece of geyserite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
give a person of Old Faithful, the Giant,
or the Giantess, in action?</p>

<p>Baptism with water is an outward sign of
an inner work, but there are multitudes who
are satisfied with the souvenir and go blindly
on to the Judgment to find their mistake when
it is too late to make amends. There can be no
excuse on account of ignorance, for the Scriptures
furnish abundant evidence that there
must be a work wrought by the Holy Spirit in
the heart before a person is ready for the skies.</p>

<p>There is no better illustration of the sanctified
experience than that which the geysers
demonstrate. Jesus said to the woman at the
well, "But whosoever drinketh of the water
that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the
water that I shall give him shall be in him a
well of water springing up into everlasting
life."</p>

<p>So with one who obtains the living water,&mdash;he
has an inexhaustible supply, springing up in
his soul. Outward conditions do not affect the
deep whence it has its source, but it flows on regardless
of conditions on the surface, bringing
life and happiness to multitudes.</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon, we
boarded one of the touring cars to Yellowstone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Montana, the Western Entrance to the Park,
where there is a branch terminal of the Union
Pacific Railroad. A little more than four days
had elapsed since we started on the tour at
Cody, Wyoming, but to me it was the beginning
of a new epoch, and I felt that enough had been
crowded into the four days to talk and write
about for the rest of my life. I had stocked up
my storehouse with a supply of illustrations to
be used in books and Gospel exhortations; and
not only expected to profit by what I had seen,
but to do what I could to make an impression
upon others; and the result so far has been
satisfactory.</p>

<span class="i0">He stumbled upon a most singular place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas deep in the midst of a mountainous range,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surrounded by valleys secluded and strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a country the greatest, the grandest, the best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be found upon earth&mdash;America's West.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the crust seemed quite thin, and the purified air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the chemicals hidden around everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would soon make the lakes that the Devil desired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he flew to Chicago, and there to him wired:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I've found you a place never looked at before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may heat up the rocks, turn on water, and bore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the Devil with mortals kept plying the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extracting the water around from the mire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boring great holes with a terrible dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till soon quite a number appeared near the crust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he turned on the steam&mdash;and lo! upward did fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through rents in the surface, the rocks to the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with a rumble there came from each spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge volumes of water remarkably hot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That had been there in caverns since Lucifer fell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus immensely enlarging the confines of Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it happens that now when Old Charon brings in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A remarkable load of original sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That His Majesty quietly rakes up the coals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up spouts the water, in jets, through the holes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One may tell by the number of spurts when they come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many poor mortals the Devil takes home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Yankees can sometimes, without doing evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'ermatch in sagacity even the Devil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not long ago Uncle Sam came that way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said to himself, "Here's the Devil to pay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Successful I've been in all previous wars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Satan shall bow to the Stripes and the Stars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This property's mine, and I hold it in fee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all of this earth shall its majesty see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deer and the elk unmolested shall roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bear and the buffalo each have a home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eagle shall spring from her eyrie and soar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er crags in the canyons where cataracts roar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild fowls shall circle the pools in their flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The geysers shall flash in the moonbeams at night,<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
